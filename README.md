# Crack-your-MCQ-round

To get started with this process you have to get API in [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

After getting the API, you update it in `API.txt`.

To run the server, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```
To run AI capture, run the following commands:

```bash
PS D:\vision> python -m venv .venv
PS D:\vision> .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
(.venv) PS D:\vision> pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) PS D:\vision> python main.py
```

After running this, you will get a Crack-your-MCQ-round pop-up window on your screen that asks you to press 'A' to capture.

To get started, press `A`. It will capture the current screen and answer your MCQ questions like a boss. It also shows the current status of execution.

**Main points to note:**

1. To capture the current screen, press `A`.
2. It will give you the answer.
3. Again, press `A` to capture the screen.
4. This capture process repeats until you close the pop-up window.


**Note:**  I did this just for my learning purpose. I will not be responsible for anything. Clearing aptitude rounds is difficult and not related to technical skills, which is why I made it. But this is at your own risk.
